# Data-Base-Cardiology-department-website
Briefly, In this project I tried to make a demo for a cardiology department data base system in a hospital using HTML, CSS, MySQL, Python and Flask. There are four main webpages Homepage, Amin page, Doctors page, Patient page. Homepage have hyperlinks to the 3 other pages, as you can only access the three pages after accepted signing in or   signing up into admin, doctor and patient accounts (no signing up for admins only the hospital can add admins to the account using database directly). Admin page can add and view any data in data base tables such as (Doctors, Patients, Nurse, Procedures, Prescription, etc...) tables. Doctors can view their patients and the the appointments sent to them by patients. Patients can add appointment with and doctor as long as they know his name and email.
